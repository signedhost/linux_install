# rapingme_install
An automatic signed.host installer for linux.


## So, how to run it?

### You can easily open it by downloading it with git:

```
git clone https://github.com/allaboutexhaust/signed_install.git
```
Then:

```
cd signed_install && sh install.sh
```

### Or, install it through curl:

```
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allaboutexhaust/signed_install/master/install.sh)"
```

## Dependencies required to work:

You need four of them, you can get them at your distribution's package mirror (AUR for arch linux, apt for debian linux, etc.)

```
kdialog, flameshot, xclip, xbindkeys
```

Install **every one of them** in order to install raping.me.
